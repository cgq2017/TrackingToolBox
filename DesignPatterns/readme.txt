This CD contains the complete ANSI/ISO-compatible C++ source code forC++ Design Patterns and Derivatives PricingByMark S. JoshiPublished by Cambridge University Press 2004Copyright Mark S. Joshi 2004USING THE CODEThe code has been been placed in three directories:C/include, C/source and C/mains. Each mainprogram indicate which source files must be included in the sameproject for the code to link. The include files are includedusing < > so the directory  C/include must be included inthe list of places your compiler looks for include files. In Visual C++, thedirectories for include files can be changed via the menus tools, options,directories. Makefiles, project files, etc are not included as they are highlycompiler dependent. COMPILERSThe code has been tested under three compilers: MingW2.95, Borland 5.5 and Visual C++ 6.0. The first two of these areavailable for free so you should have no trouble finding a compilerthat the code works for. In addition, MingW is the windows port of theGNU compiler, gcc, so the code should work with that compiler too. Visual C++ is not free but is popular in the city and the introductoryversion is not very expensive. In addition, the author has strived not to useany non ANSI/ISO code so the code should work under anycompiler. In any case, it does not use any cutting edge languagefeatures so if it is not compatible with your compiler, fixing theproblems should not be hard. LICENCEThe code is released under an artistic license. This means that youcan do what you like with it, provided that if you redistribute thesource code you allow the receiver to do what they like with it too. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTYThe CD-ROM is provided without warranty of any kind.
